## ISDNPlus

This is one of my first applications that had a real purpose. It worked on the now already old but back in 2003 quite popular technology of ISDN (that was a step up from dial-up modems). If you had such a line at home and compute equipped with an ISDN card you could have used this software to arrange your address book and see who is calling you on your computer screen. The user base was huge (2 users) and included both home users (me) and enterprise (my fathers company). It was in service for several years. Even when ISDN went out of fashion my father used it till 2009 for his address book, until I wrote a short script to transfer my "proprietary" data base format to CSV. 

# Features

* ISDN Caller ID as windows task bar popup
* Support multiple numbers on same line (so called MSN)
* Address book of contacts (each contact could have more then one number)
* Call log
* Option to run at startup
* Possibility to lookup the number on the online directory (worked only in Croatia)

Here on the left you can see the call log with number, name (if in your address book) and time of call. On the right you have the address book with display name, first name and last name.

This is an example of the popup. At the moment it's not showing the caller ID because the number was hidden.
